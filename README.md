# 🔒 Real-Time Threat Detection System Using Apache Spark

This project is a real-time security log analysis system built with **Apache Spark (Scala)** to detect suspicious or malicious activities using **big data processing** and **streaming analytics**.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time ingestion of security logs via Kafka
- Anomaly and threat detection (brute-force, port scans, DDoS patterns, etc.)
- Integration with Spark MLlib for behavioral analysis
- Scalable and fault-tolerant using Apache Spark Structured Streaming
- Dashboard/API for viewing detected threats
- Alerting system via email or webhooks

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

* Scala 2.12+
* Apache Spark 3.x
* Apache Kafka
* sbt (Scala Build Tool)
* PostgreSQL or Elasticsearch (optional)
* Docker (optional for deployment)

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/threat-detector
cd threat-detector
```

### 3. Start Kafka (Optional Docker Setup)

```bash
cd kafka-setup
./setup.sh
```

This will create the topic `raw-logs`.

### 4. Run Spark Streaming Job

```bash
cd spark-streaming
sbt run
```

Or using spark-submit:

```bash
spark-submit \
  --class Main \
  --master local[2] \
  target/scala-2.12/threat-detector-assembly-0.1.jar
```

## 🧪 Detection Logic

### Rule-Based Examples:

* 🚨 **Brute-force login**: >10 failed login attempts from same IP in 5 minutes
* 🕵️ **Port scan**: Requests to >100 ports from one IP in 1 minute
* 🕒 **Suspicious timing**: Access between 2 AM - 4 AM from a rare IP

### ML-Based (Optional):

* Use KMeans or IsolationForest from Spark MLlib for outlier detection
* Label normal vs abnormal behavior over time

---

## 📊 Dashboard (Optional)

* The dashboard is a simple REST API built with Play Framework or HTTP4s.
* Displays:

  * Recent threats
  * Count of threats by type
  * GeoIP info (optional)

---

## 📦 Future Enhancements

* ✅ Delta Lake integration for ACID & versioned storage
* ✅ GeoIP-based anomaly detection
* ✅ Integration with ELK stack
* ✅ Prometheus/Grafana for metrics monitoring
* ✅ Kubernetes deployment (Helm chart)
